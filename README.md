## Project Description:

The Library System is an application that allows the users to access the book collection of a library. The homepage of the application displays the book collection in a tabular form with the booksâ€™ name, author, and the number of copies available in the system. The user can also add books to the database system with a name, author, and number of copies. You are also given the option to remove the certain books from the catalog. The library system is a 3-tier architecture since we have a presentation, business logic, and a database. The software required to create the application include: 

- ReactJS for the UI.
- Java Spring Boot for the backend API application.
- AWS RDS for the data storage.
- Docker to run applications in containers easily.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
